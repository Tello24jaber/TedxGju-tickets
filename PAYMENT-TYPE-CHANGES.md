# Summary of Changes - Payment Type Feature

## What Was Changed

I've successfully updated your TEDxGJU ticket system to handle the new **Payment Type** field from your Google Form. Here's what was modified:

## Files Changed

### 1. Type Definitions (3 files)
- ✅ `shared/types.ts` - Added `payment_type` field
- ✅ `apps/api/src/types.ts` - Added `payment_type` field
- ✅ `apps/web/src/types.ts` - Added `payment_type` field

### 2. Backend (API)
- ✅ `apps/api/src/services/google-sheets.ts` - Now extracts payment type from sheets
- ✅ `apps/api/src/routes/admin.ts` - Now stores payment type in database

### 3. Frontend (Web UI)
- ✅ `apps/web/src/pages/Queue.tsx` - Added "Payment" column to table
- ✅ `apps/web/src/pages/RequestDetail.tsx` - Shows payment type and handles Cash vs Cliq logic

### 4. Database
- ✅ `docs/schema.sql` - Updated main schema
- ✅ `docs/migration-add-payment-type.sql` - New migration file to add column

### 5. Documentation
- ✅ `docs/PAYMENT-TYPE-FEATURE.md` - Complete feature documentation

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Payment Type Tracking**
The system now captures and displays the payment method (Cash, Cliq, etc.) from your Google Form.

### 2. **Smart Proof of Payment Display**
- **Cash payments**: Shows a blue info box stating "Cash Payment - No proof required"
- **Other payments (Cliq, etc.)**: Shows the proof of payment link as before

### 3. **Updated UI**
- Queue page now has a "Payment" column showing the payment type
- Request detail page shows payment type and conditionally displays proof based on the payment method

## What You Need to Do

### 1. **Run Database Migration** (IMPORTANT!)
Execute this SQL in your Supabase database:

```sql
ALTER TABLE purchase_requests 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS payment_type TEXT;

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_purchase_requests_payment_type ON purchase_requests(payment_type);
```

Or use the provided migration file: `docs/migration-add-payment-type.sql`

### 2. **Verify Google Form Column Names**
Your Google Sheet should have these columns (case-insensitive):
- Timestamp
- Full Name (or any column with "name")
- Email (or any column with "email")
- Phone Number (or any column with "phone")
- Proof Of Payment (or any column with "proof")
- **Payment Type** (or any column with "payment")

The system will automatically match these column headers.

### 3. **Deploy the Changes**
After running the migration, deploy your updated API and Web applications.

## Example Workflow

1. User fills Google Form and selects "Cash" as Payment Type → No proof required
2. Admin clicks "Sync Google Sheets" 
3. Admin sees the request in Queue with "Cash" in Payment column
4. Admin clicks "Review"
5. Admin sees "Cash Payment - No proof required" instead of proof link
6. Admin approves the request

## Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check that the database migration ran successfully
2. Verify the Google Sheet column names match what the code expects
3. Check browser console for any errors
4. Review the documentation in `docs/PAYMENT-TYPE-FEATURE.md`

---

All changes are backward compatible - existing requests without payment_type will still work fine!
